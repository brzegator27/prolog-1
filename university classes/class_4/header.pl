% File with loaders of all(save this) Prolog files from this
% directory with all predicates. Previous apporaches
% showed that, afer a while it is hard to remember
% what each predicate is doing, and in which file it is
% placed, thus now each predicate and they tests are
% in one file.

% underscore character at the end of predicate's name
% denote the implementation's version's number
% because we can sometimes do one thing in different ways
